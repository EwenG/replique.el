** Starting a Clojure REPL

[[file:images/clojure-repl.gif]]

- To start a Clojure REPL, simply run the command =M-x= =replique/repl=.
- You are then asked to select the root directory of a Clojure project.
- If you are starting a Clojure REPL for the first time, Replique may ask you to download a Clojure jar. In such a case, you can save the jar file in your =$PATH= in order for Replique to find it on subsequent REPL startups. Note that you may have to set your =$PATH= variable before starting emacs. For example, here is my .profile: export PATH="${PATH}:~/bin" .
