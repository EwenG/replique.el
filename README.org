#+TITLE:	Replique
#+AUTHOR:	Ewen Grosjean

Replique is an emacs mode for Clojure and Clojurescript development.

# * Main goals
# ** Minimum configuration needed to start a coding session.
# This is mainly made possible by the fact that supporting non-development setups (ie: packaging code and resources for production) is a non-goal.
# ** Full Clojurescript support.

* Installation
At the moment, the only way to install Replique is by loading replique.el by
 hand or during emacs startup.

* Getting started
The only requiremnt to get started is to have emacs installed and the replique
 mode loaded.

** Starting a Clojure REPL

To start a Clojure REPL, simply run the command =M-x= =replique/repl=.
