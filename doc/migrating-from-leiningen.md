# Migrating from Leiningen

Replique can only be run with the Clojure [command line tools](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli). 
It does not support tools such as [Boot](https://github.com/boot-clj/boot) or [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen).

If you are coming from Leiningen you might want to check [lein-to-deps](https://github.com/EwenG/lein-to-deps) to produce a deps.edn file out of a project.clj file.
