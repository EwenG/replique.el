# Building/packaging an application

Replique can only be run with the Clojure [command line tools](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli). 
It does not support tools such as [Boot](https://github.com/boot-clj/boot) or [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen).

There is not necessarily a need to create an artifact in order to share your application/library.
Although if you are looking for a way to publish your application as a maven artifact or to create a standalone bundle, you may be interested in [Badigeon](https://github.com/EwenG/badigeon).
