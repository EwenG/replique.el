# Finding usages

The `replique/find-usage` (`C-c C-u`) command searches for usages of the thing at point in either the project directory, the classpath, or a chosen directory.
The `replique/find-usage` command can be used with vars, keywords, classes or namespaces.


The `replique/find-usage` command works by recursively walking file system directories.
It can be slow when entering a deep directory hierarchy. A file named `.repliqueignore` can be added to any directory to be excluded from the search.

The `replique/find-usage` does not perform static analysis and does not require the build of an index.

##Â Shortcomings

The `replique/find-usage` command does not work with special forms.

The `replique/find-usage` command works by searching for patterns in the visited files.
As a consequence, it cannot find definitions generated by macros such as the constructors generated by [deftype](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/deftype) and [defrecord](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/deftype).

The `replique/find-usage` command does not analyzes local bindings. As a consequence, it may return false positive when searching for usages of unqualified symbols.
Since qualified symbols cannot be used as locals, this does not impact the searches for usages of qualified symbols.
I would advice to sparingly use the [`use`](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/use) function and the `:refer` option of [`require`](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/require).
This should limit the impact of this shortcoming.
