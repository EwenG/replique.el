# Theses are only personal notes. Don't pay attention. Things are getting pushed to the github issues as they mature.

* Clojurescript browser REPL client.js generation without google closure optimizations (span multiple files)
* Caching of Clojure namespaces scanning using the classpath
* Printing of object should be overrided with care (print-method must print EDN valid data, or a regexp or a var)
* Refactor replique/completion for mit license.
* Evaluation is slow when the browser tab where the browser REPL is started is not selected.
* Rename java.json packages to avoid polutting the namespaces
* Sass
- Webapp env -> replique starts the browser REPL so: Possibility to connect to the browser REPL even when not a clojurescript app. Need a browser extension to reconnect on every page reload.
* browser.cljs uses window.onload to load the cljs repl. Use the DomContentLoaded event instead
