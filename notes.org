# Theses are only personal notes. Don't pay attention. Things are getting pushed to the github issues as they mature.

* Clojurescript browser REPL client.js generation without google closure optimizations (span multiple files)
* Caching of Clojure namespaces scanning using the classpath
* Printing of object should be overrided with care (print-method must print EDN valid data, or a regexp or a var)
* Refactor replique-edn and replique/completion for mit license.
* Evaluation is slow when the browser tab where the browser REPL is started is not selected.
